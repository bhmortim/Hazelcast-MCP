# =============================================================================
# Hazelcast MCP Server — Docker Compose Developer Quickstart
# =============================================================================
#
# Quick start:
#   docker compose up
#
# This brings up:
#   1. A single-node Hazelcast cluster with Jet enabled
#   2. A demo data loader that populates financial trading data, then exits
#   3. The MCP server connected to Hazelcast, ready for AI agent integration
#
# SSE mode (network-accessible MCP):
#   HAZELCAST_MCP_TRANSPORT=sse docker compose up
#   → MCP SSE endpoint available at http://localhost:3000/sse
